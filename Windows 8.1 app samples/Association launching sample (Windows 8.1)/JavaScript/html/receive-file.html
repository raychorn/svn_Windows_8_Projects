            Create a file with a .alsdkjs extension. In the files app, launch that file. This sample sets the DesiredView element within the FileType extension category to "useLess". When you launch the sample from another app, such as the files app, this preference tells the system to attempt to use a smaller portion of the screen for the sample and leave the rest for other apps.
