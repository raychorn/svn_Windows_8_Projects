        <h3>Live Tiles are the representation of an application in Start and you can use tile and badge 
            notifications to display new, relevant, and tailored content to the user.
            <br />
        </h3>
        <p>
            Tile notifications are specified in an XML format and contain text and images in a pre-defined layout.
            <br />
            <br />
            Applications must always include a square (square150x150) logo in the manifest. Similarly, if an application
            wants to use wide (wide310x150) templates, it MUST include a wide (wide310x150) logo with it as well.
            Applications that want to use square310x310 templates MUST include both wide310x150 and square310x310 logos.

            This pattern is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED since users decide what size your application's tile will be.
            <br />
            <br />
            Given below are two different use cases. Before you send the notifications make sure that you pin the tile to your start screen. 
            Once you send the notification check how the pinned tile shows those updates.
        </p>

        <h3>First Scenario:</h3>
        This scenario demonstrates how you can send a tile notification with just text using the Notifications Extensions Library methods.
        <br />
        <button id="sendTileTextNotification">Send tile notification with text</button>
        <button id="clearTileNotification">Clear tile</button>
        <br />
        <br />

        <h3>Second Scenario:</h3>
        Since notifications are simply XML, you can create them in many different ways. For example, here we create notifications by constructing strings. 
        As mentioned above, it's always a good idea to send XML for multiple tile sizes for the best user experience.
        <br />
        <button id="sendTileTextNotificationWithStringManipulation">Send tile notification created with strings</button>
        <button id="sendTileTextNotificationWithXmlManipulation">Send tile notification created with XML</button>
    </div>
